## Instructions
The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. The goal of the game is for the user to guess the letter the computer is "thinking" by pressing a key on the keyboard.

The user will have 10 chances to guess the correct letter, otherwise it will count as a loss and it will add +1 to losses. The game will output each incorrect guess the user makes.

Every time the user guesses a letter correctly, their wining score will increase by one.

The game will prevent the user from making any guesses that aren't letters from A to Z, as well as from repeating previous guesses. Neither of these mistakes will count as one of the user's 10 chances nor the current score.

Each time the user wins or loses, the game will restart without reloading the page. However, if you want to restart the winning and losing score then you're going to need to refresh the page.

I hope you enjoy the game!
